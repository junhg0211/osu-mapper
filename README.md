> osu! key midi mapper made for me

I use `Nektar Impact GX49` on my desk.
When I'm playing [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/),
the midi keyboard really is annoying.
So I just decided to map keyboard keys from midi keys,
made me able to play osu! without my actual keyboard.

I mapped `S` and `D` as osu!standard keys,
so the `C1` and `D1` key in the midi keyboard will activate the `S` and `D` keys,
and also, `C#1` for `escape`, `D#1` and `E1` for `F1` and `F2`, `F1` for `space` is mapped.

We also trace of `keys per second (KPS)`.
It can be re-set by pressing `F#1` key in the midi keyboard.

Yeet!
